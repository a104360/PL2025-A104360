## Resumo

Pretende-se implementar o programa somador on/off através da linguagem Python.

O programa consiste no comportamento de somar as sequências de dígitos que 
estejam escritas num texto (a implementação irá tratar o texto lendo do stdin).

Com o aparecimento da string "Off" em qualquer combinação de maiúsculas e minúsculas, 
o comportamento deixa de estar ativo.

De forma inversa, o aparecimento da string "On" com qualquer combinação de 
maiúsculas e minúsculas, torna o comportamento ativo novamente.
